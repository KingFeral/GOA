Exploding Clone now marks the user's location and triggers when attacked, creating an exploding clone that target tricks anyone actively targeting you (Int-based damage; uses the Trap Mastery passive). The user reappears at the marked location. The traditional Exploding Clone can be used by holding Shift prior to activation (it can also use skills).
Caltrops are equippable and land two tiles in front of the user, slowing and damaging anyone on that location.
Explosions no longer hit twice.
Change Chidori back to the way it was before, with that addition that Rfx allows it to charge faster. Damage should be based on distance and Rfx.
