BUGS,
//Brutality fails to destroy clones.
Brutality doesn't do damage?
Block-spam blocks all taijutsu.
Jutsu can be used multiple times.
//Rock Shinobi are not deleting properly. (FIXED, I THINK)
//Escorts don't cross maps. (FIXED)

TODO,
Remove Pills' damage reduction.
//Change Shunshin to 1.21.
Change Body Replacement to Dan's version.
Buff taijutsu damage (I'll buff combo for this)

UPDATES,
CTR is based more on CON than STR now. (The formula is: ((strength / 2) + (control) / 2) + 0.2 * medical training
Changed Body Replacement to Dan's version (the old mechanics with a distance limit of 30 tiles)
Changed Body Flicker's cooldown with capped Speed Demon passives back to 1 second. The chakra cost is 80 chakra.
