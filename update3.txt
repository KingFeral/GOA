PUPPETEER
//-Poison Bomb doesn't work.
//-Needle Gun doesn't work (icon doesn't show).

WATER ELEMENT
//-Lowered the damage on both Water Colliding Wave and Giant Water Colliding Wave.
//-Water Dragon can be used without water but only does 60% of its damage. Changed the Skill Points to learn it from 800 to 2,000. Raised the damage considerably and made it multi-target capable.

MISC
//-Chakra Taijutsu Release was buffed (450 STR/CON and full Medical Training passives would deal roughly 2.1k). Also no longer takes boosts into account.
//-Chakra Scalpels shouldn't slow as much from normal hits (given the dash).
//-Raised Tajuu Shuriken's damage to 300 per shuriken (from 200).
//MABS should use more kunai and do a minimum wound damage of 1. (MABs wound damage is based on Bombardment. Also increased the spread.)
//Buff kunai (it needs a dash)
//Buff taijutsu (needs a dash)
//Buff Gates (levels 1-3 will allow the user to dash +x tiles when using taijutsu, x being equal to the Gate level. Gates 4+ will teleport when using taijutsu as long as the user is within x tiles of the target, x being equal to the Gate level + 1.) Able to be knocked out in Gates 1-3.

BUGFIXES

//-Nara's Shadow Bind is dense at the head.
//-Doton Chamber can be crushed multiple times.
