PUPPETEER
	-Needle Gun does not work (doesn't shoot).

GATES // DONE
	-Each Gate up to level 4 allows you to dash.
	skills cost 25% more chakra, stamina bonus now 150%. gates 1-3, str/rfx increase, 1(or 2) tile dash on taijutsu, can only use kawa/shunshin. 
Gate 1: 15% boost, 
Gate 2: 25% boost 
Gate 3: 35% boost, chakra refill, can not be ko'd
Gate 4: 50% boost, stamina refill
Gate 5: 65% boost
youth: gain 1 wound every 3 seconds. amount increases by 1 every 30 seconds. every new gate reduces it by 5 seconds
non-youths: gain 2 wounds every 3 seconds. amount increases by 1 every 25s. every new gate reduces by 5 seconds
Gates now teleport/dash you to the closest side of the target (if you're behind him it will teleport you to his back)
Gates 1-3 can be used indefinitely. Gate 4 has a 25s duration, Gate 5 has a 20s duration
Add timer for gate duration
Healing amount is reduced by 70% (can not be healed in gates)
Drawback:
youth: For every wound gained by gates, the user takes an extra (.50*wounds)% damage || (if you took 50 wounds from gates, you'd take an extra 25% damage)
non-youth: For every wound gained by gates, the user takes an extra (1*wounds)% damage || (if you took 50 wound from gates, you'd take an extra 50% damage)
